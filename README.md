> This is a working POC, full of terrible code.

## Why? How?

Human IDs are IDs that are:

* Easy to say out loud
* Short
* Easy to type on a keyboard
* Have repeating characters or numbers when possible
* Have no confusing characters (e.g. 0 and O, 1 and I, etc.)

### Intended use cases

* Customer support
* Order numbers
* Invoice numbers
* Coupon codes
* Referral codes

These IDs are not intended to be used as primary keys in a database.

### Features

Features I want (from less feasible to most feasible):
* Sortability
* Collision resistance (in a way that makes sense considering the use case)
* URL-safe / Cookie-safe
